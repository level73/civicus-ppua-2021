                <p>In an attempt to capture these dynamics on a global scale, <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/researchpartners/">over 20 organisations</a> from around the world have joined forces on the CIVICUS Monitor to provide an evidence base for action to improve civic space. In order to draw comparisons at the global level and track trends over time, the CIVICUS Monitor produces civic space ratings for 196 countries. Each country’s civic space is rated in one of five categories – open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed or closed – based on a <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/methodology/">methodology</a> that combines several sources of data on the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression.</p>
                <p>Civic space updates from CIVICUS Monitor research partners contain qualitative, narrative information related to the situation for civil society in a country. This qualitative information is directed by a set of<a href="https://www.civicus.org/documents/civicus-monitor-methodology-paper.pdf"> guiding questions</a> and the resulting data is gathered from a variety of primary and secondary sources. In many cases, country-specific updates come directly from national civil society themselves. In countries where we do not have a research partner, the CIVICUS Monitor relies on a variety of other sources produced at the national, regional and international levels to arrive at country ratings. These civic space updates are then triangulated, verified and<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/newsfeed/"> tagged</a> by the CIVICUS team.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Together, the research partners posted 516<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/">civic space updates</a> from 12 November 2019 to 31 October 2020, which form the basis for the analysis presented in this report. For the time period assessed, these civic space updates cover 153 countries.This report analyses trends and developments since our previous <a href="https://civicus.contentfiles.net/media/assets/file/GlobalReport2019.pdf">report</a>, published in December 2019. As well as global-level trends, it analyses trends in five regions: Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).</p>

                                <p>At the heart of the CIVICUS Monitor’s methodology is the combination of several independent data sources, comprising both quantitative and qualitative data. These sources include updated ratings from civil society organisations and reports from national, regional, and international civil society organisations with relevant information on the four indicators of civic space (Freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and the state duty to protect). These external analyses are then paired with CIVICUS’ own analysis to arrive at country ratings for all assessed countries and territories, ranging from open to narrowed, obstructed, repressed or closed.</p>

                                <p>Recognising that indicators used to conceptualise civic space cannot be directly observed or assessed by a single measure, our methodology constructs a composite indicator to provide an overall view of conditions in each country. To do so, we created a fixed scale which establishes the range of the CIVICUS Monitor, i.e. we impose a minimum and a maximum theoretically possible value. This range encompasses a range of completely unrestricted (100) to completely restricted (1) civic spaces. Given that the state of civic space across all countries and territories vary from very restricted to more open, we can be reasonably confident that the range we set up is broad enough to encompass the variety of civic experiences around the world.</p>

The advantage of our approach is that we give greater voice to national level civil society organisations producing data on civic space violations. We contend that actors closer to the source are best able to contextualise information and that potential incentives for over-stating restrictions are offset by local organisations' interest in remaining credible.</p>

                                <p>On a periodic basis and in response to developments on the ground, CIVICUS researchers also conduct structured interviews with country-based civil society representatives. Based on these interviews, the CIVICUS researcher assesses the current trend in a country and assigns an additional “country consultation” score. In addition, anyone could submit verified information to our researchers and CIVICUS team will channel that information to our Research Partners. </p>
